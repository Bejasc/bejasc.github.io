title: First blog post!
---

This is the first blog post using Jekyll-Now. It seems like a pretty good system - I have made some basic changes to the markdown, css, and configuration files, in order to customise the site to my liking. 

I've added the new 'Projects' page - which I will use to link to _other_ sites built using Jekyll-Now, for project specific dev blogs and such.

I'll look into including a way to specify which project any particular post links to, and see if I can do some custom styling or presentation or just some basic representation of it's project link, so that posts are readable both through this page, and the project specific page.
